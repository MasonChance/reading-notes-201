# Node.js

Node is a javascript interpreter and library that alows your local machine to run javascript without being connected to the internet. 

Node Package Manager and Node Version Manager allow you to set which version of Node you want to use on a case by case basis. 

Node bridges the gap between different versions of JS so that you dont have to manually install different interpreters every time you want to use JS locally. 

Node is non-blocking which means that it will allow all other OS operations to continue while it waits to recieve the request back from the server.
