# Heroku cloud deployment

heroku is a cloud based service that allows you to publish your locally created server to the web at large. 

server works with a package.json file and and any .js files to allow the server to communicate with the http and any associated requests. 

after deploying your server application locally it can be hosted on heroku. how large application and how long the application will run are dependent on your heroku account but because it is cloud based if you need more server space you can add more ps:web nodes allowing for easy scaling of a project.
