# responsive/adaptive web-design

responsive design refers to incorporating dynamic elements into website/application development that allow it to change based on user input/device differences, adaptive design is closely related refering to the use of dynamic element layout that changes based on user viewport-size and browser compatibility. both make use of percentages or em units to maintain the basic flow of the site regardless of screen size, to ensure a cohesive UX. 

the way that we accomplish responsive desgin at a structural level is to use a grid set up, identifiying the parent containing elements and using equations to calculate the relative positioning of their children. another method that has been gaining popularity is the use of flex boxes which allow you to control even the directional flow of elements on the page.
