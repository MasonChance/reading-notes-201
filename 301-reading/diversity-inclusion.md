# inclusion and diversity

Diversity spans more than just ethnicity and gender though these are often the easiest to point out for a variety of reasons. Even if we restrict our observations to the most easily identifiable areas of diversity/inclusion, the fact remains that more diverse teams create more revenue for their company and are more productive. weather or not the benefits are passed directly to those teams/team-memebers is a seperate issue. 

being aware of unconscious bias is important not only an individual level but also in assessing your data sets when workign with dataanalyssis and esspecially when choosing data for building an ai.
