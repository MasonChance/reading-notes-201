# More on APIs

APIs allow you to access information from a third party application. getting a key requires signup and depending on your usecase and weather you have a free or paid acount the number of requests at any given frequency is limited by the api provider. 

if your app is dependent on multiple apis it may be helpful to have an api management system to help youkeep track of them and update your api when you need to.
