# Text Structure & Markup Types

Html uses tags (discussed earlier [Html-Index](html-topics/html-index.md)) to tell the browser how it should render the content for the page. There are two categories of tags used in html both with their own designated purpose. We will do a brief overview below.

## Structural Markup

We met Structural mark up earlier when we talked about the `<h1>`,`<p>`, and other tags that define the page to the browser. These elements are the bones of the html creature.

## Semantic Markup

  Semantic Markup is used to give a little context to the content almost strictly for the purpose of accessability. An example would be for someone using a screen reader, it tells the browser a little bit of extra information. Semantic markup Is **NOT** used to change the *appearance* of the website, that task is reserved for styling with CSS or inline-styling. 

  Examples of Semantic markup include `<em>` for italics, `<strong>` for bold and `<abbr>` to define an accronym.
