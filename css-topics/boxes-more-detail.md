# Box Model, a Closer Look

We discussed the box model breifly In our [CSS Overview](/reading-notes-201/css-topics/css-topics/css-index) for convenience I've also included the diagram from the overview here. Now lets look at what we can do with the box-model and how it influences page design.

## Dimensions
there are many things that influence box dimensions most of them are auxillary to "width" and "hieght" and don't affect the dimensions directly they merely give context or conditions for the basic width height values. unless otherwise specified, element boxes take up as much space as is needed  to fit their contents. Height and Width values can be specified in pixels, %ofpage or structural element, and ems which are relative to the content of the box. as discussed previously you can also alter the dimensions of the box by specifying: Borders, Padding, and Margin. you can also add images and shadows to the box and change its apparent shape. for more on the specific attributes see [w3schools Css reference](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/default.asp).
