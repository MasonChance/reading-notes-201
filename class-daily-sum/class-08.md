# CSS Layout shennanigans

## building blocks
blocklevel elements are the main peice of html pages and form the basis for positiong in relation to each other. each element is the direct child of the element that contains it. control the space a box takes up by setting width and sometimes even height. 

### normal flow. 
each element starts on a new line. even if you set the width to have space for another. 

### Relative positioning
moves the element from normal flow, to the top right bottom left. this does not affect the positioning of other elements. 

### absolute positioning. 
positions the element in relation to it's direct parent and does not affect the layout of other elements they simply ignore the space it would otherwise have taken. 

### fixed position

positions elements in relation to the browser window rather than other elements. these do not move when a user scrolls the page. 

### floating Elements

take them out of normal flow and allow other elements to flow around them.
