# Storage

Historically web application storage has varied widely accross browsers and a massive number of workarounds were explored because browsers could only store information temporarily or would send cookies with every singel http request slowing down computers everywhere and opening up the field for a lot of weak points in security. 

Html5 makes use of a new local storage application that bridges the gap between varying browsers and creates a local storage space for each point of origin. by having a stand alone built in database it allows for much more local storage. it's to early to tell what the landscape will look like regarding SQL and Gears but HTML5 built in local storage has a major advantage. no plug-ins required and all browsers suport it, even IE which is saying something because IE doesn't support very much of anything!!!
