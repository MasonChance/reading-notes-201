# Team dynamics and CSS Transform


## Aristotle
Googles project Aristotle spent well over a year gathering data from over 128 teams accross the company to identify and research the attributes that comprised the most effective teams and weather or not that lined up with "conventional wisdom" long story short... &&. the research revealed that things like, background diversity, skill level, education, introvert/extrovert, agenda driven or laise faire, the things that actually made the difference when comparing effective teams where:

- Evenly distributed communication accross the group as a whole
- the sense of saftey amongst members that it was ok to speak up and be heard without risk of being attacked or demeaned
- and a strongly shared sense of clarity of purpose, a clear group sense of the teams mission and a belief in it. 

other data and factors were explored and touch on a great many other topics but this about sums up all the salient points. 

## CSS Text transform. 

the transform property has multiple prefixes that bolster the use on various browsers with differing support capabilities. until greater skill is accquired, using the prefixes is highly recomended. 

elements/content cand be transformed in either 2-D or 3-D.
- Rotate: is measured in degrees and horizontal or vertical rotation. the epicenter of rotation is by default the center of the object
- Scale: changes the appearent size of the element using a floating point decimal to express a percent of the original size.


## Transistions 

elements can be set to have a change state and a base state so that a transistion can be applied and triggered on a given instance. values for this property include *duration* and *timing* *triggering event*

many other animation and styling options are available but these build the foundation for CSS based interactivity for a website.
