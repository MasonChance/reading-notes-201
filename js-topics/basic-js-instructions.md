# Basic JS Syntax and Instructions

We talked about computers approching problems differently than a human would in our general overview [JS-Index](/reading-notes-201/js-topics/js-index): 

`...If you've ever been in a position to train a person how to do a task you were probably able to get by with giving general instructions and trusting them to use their own judgement about details. This generally is ok because most of us have common frames of reference. Computers do not have any frames of reference, imagine trying to teach someone how to cook something; But they don't know what a pan is, or a stove is or what the qualities or properties of those things were, so then you have to teach them about those before you can teach them about that...`

Now lets get into the specifics, the parts of speach as it were. 

## Components of the Language. 

- **Statements/Declarations**: any instruction given to the computer is either a statement or a declaration. A declaration tells the computer what something is, the easiest example is when we declare a *variable* using `var` as in the example above this is like telling the computer what a "pan" is or a "stove" once we have declared the components we can make statements about them. a statement is the instruction we give to the computer. "take this variable I have declared and do 'this' with  it" 

- **Variables**: These are the bricks of the code, with no bricks the program has nothing to do anything with. Declaring a Variable stores the value it is assigned in memory to be referenced later. 

- **Code Blocks**: `{ }` curly braces are used to define a code block; A code block is a container for the statements we are giving to the program. we'll talk more about this when we talk about *scope*

- **namingVariables**: it is important to give variables unique and descriptive names, it becomes difficult to understand your code otherwise and can cause problems that interupt your workflow later. Variable names are case sensitive, the common practice is to use *camelCase* when declaring variables. 

- **Operators**: special characters that describe or influence the interaction of variables and statements with each other. examples included `+`, `&&`, `||` and others. reference link will be added to this page at a later date. 

- **Data Types**: variables hold differnt types of data which have different rules in terms of how the browser interprets them. *Numerical* interpreted as an integer to specified decimal point. *string* interpreted as text and *boolean* which is a result of a statement in terms of 'true/false`. 

- **properties**: the characteristics of a declared variable or statement. If the variable is the name of the thing, properties are its personality. 

- **Value**: the value assigned (indicated most often by `=`) describes the nature of the property or variable. 

- **Arrays**: these are a special type of variable that store more than one declaration of related information. 

- **Expressions**: these are a combinations of variables and statements connected by operators that the program then evaluates into a single value. 


you will notice that there is a lot of overlap in program speak with maths and algebra, the same kind of logic applies to writing code, programming language follows an order of operations similarily to "Please, Excuse, My, Dear, Aunt, Sally"; just not so easily parsed into a pnuemonic!
