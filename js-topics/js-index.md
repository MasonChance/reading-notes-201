# Javascript and Fundamentals of Programming

Computers approach tasks differently than you or I would, because of this it is important to learn how a computer thinks before diving into scripts and telling a webpage how to behave. If you've ever been in a position to train a person how to do a task you were probably able to get by with giving general instructions and trusting them to use their own judgement about details. This generally is ok because most of us have common frames of reference. Computers do not have any frames of reference, imagine trying to teach someone how to cook something; But they don't know what a pan is, or a stove is or what the qualities or properties of those things were, so then you have to teach them about those before you can teach them about that. Jokes about "common sense" and general intelligence aside, computers are exactly like that. to tell it to do something you have to first describe that something. we do this by creating *objects* then we can tell the computer what *properties* those objects have and finally we can tell it what *value* to ascribe to that property. once this is done we can finally tell the computer what to do with the object by writing a *script*. A script is basically a very explicit set of instructions describing when and how to execute the commands you have listed. 

## Designing a script
- Determine what you want the script to do
- Break this goal down into the smallest necessesary steps to accomplish that goal
- organize those steps in order of priority and sub-steps. flow charts are useful for visualization
    - components of script flow
        - Event
        - Input/Output
        - decision
            - input/output for each branch of decision
            - general steps to make new decision at each branch
        - concluding input/output


programs are essentially just models of concepts created using data in a specified syntax. Declare objects, declare properties of those objects, use scripts to define step by step instructions for "when this happens, do this". A webpage is an Html object, the elements that it contains are also objects, a script tells these objects how to interact and under what conditions to perform those interactions.
