# Script Flow and statement evaluation. 

- Declare variables
- Declare values of those variables
- Make statements about those variables describing the relationships between them and the properties they have
- Evaluate the expression
- check the results against predifined outcomes to get a single value. 

There are many statements and comparisons that can be made about variables and their relationships but at it's simplest it follows like this. 

Conditions are usually set in an "if this than do this, otherwise do this instead" format.

something occurs called an event. values of that event are compared with the expected value, a decision about which code to run next is made based on that comparison and the script either continues down the list or terminates depending on weather the correct conditions were satisfied. 

A breif note on Loops. a loop can be used in the event that the same peice of could needs to be run more than once to get the desired result. loops also depend on conditional statements to tell them weather or not to continue running or to terminate and return the value of the comparison.
