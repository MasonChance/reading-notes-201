# Functions Methods Objects Overview.
functions and Methods both hold a series of instructions and can be called on later using the function/method name. methods are pre-defined functions that are universally understood by browsers and do not have to be designed fresh anytime you need them. all you need is the name. 

a function is a series of instructions that then encapsulated and given a name within the framework of the program you are working on and then can be called by their name from anywhere in the program without haveing to write out all the instructions every time you need them. 

declare it by using the following format. ` function name the function(){ all of the instructions the function will execute }`
call it simply by writing: `name of the function();`

## Objects are 

Objects are similar to functions in that they are declared and contain statements but these statements are called properties and the properties are then given values in the code block `{ }`. from that point the object can be called and it is understood to have all of those properties and associated values. 

Objects are declared this way: ` var objectName = { propertyname01:'propertyValue', propertyname02:'propertyValue',propertyname03:'propertyValue'....etc};`

objects function much like a mash-up of arrays and css classes with functions sprinkled about liberally.
